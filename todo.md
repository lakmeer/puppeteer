## TODO

- 'Node' class is responsible for the collaboration with a trigger, it's
  representation, and the workspace. It should have a better name, and 'Node'
  should go to the abstract version currently called 'Trigger'. Trigger then
  becomes just the subtype of Nodes which have no inputs. They probably dont
  event need to be distinct in code, maybe just in the way they're organised.

- Do correct aspect scaling inside GraphicRep
